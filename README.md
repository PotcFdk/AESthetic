AESthetic
=========

C++ implementation of AES-128 for learning purposes.

It isn't intended to be used in production at all (and probably not very useful in general),  
however, if you are learning about AES it might be helpful.  
Feel free to create posts in [this project's issue tracker](https://github.com/PotcFdk/AESthetic/issues).
